# Bell24H Temple Bell Audio
# This file represents the temple bell audio for Bell24H homepage

# The Web Audio API system in bell-sound.js provides:
# - Realistic temple bell sound synthesis
# - Cross-browser compatibility
# - No file dependencies
# - Professional audio experience

# If you want to replace with actual audio files:
# 1. Record or source a temple bell sound (2-3 seconds)
# 2. Convert to MP3 and WAV formats
# 3. Replace this file with actual audio files
# 4. Update homepage to use audio files instead of Web Audio API

# Current implementation uses Web Audio API for:
# - Instant loading
# - No bandwidth usage
# - Perfect cross-browser support
# - Professional bell sound synthesis
